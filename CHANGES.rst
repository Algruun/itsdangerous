    it easier to debug certain things.


Version 0.15

Released 2012-07-11

-   Made standalone ``load_payload`` more robust by raising one specific
    error if something goes wrong.
-   Refactored exceptions to catch more cases individually, added more
    attributes.

    situations with timestamp based serializers

Version 0.14
------------

Released 2012-06-29

-   API refactoring to support different key derivations.
-   Added attributes to exceptions so that you can inspect the data even
    if the signature check failed.

------------

Released 2012-06-10

-   Small API change that enables customization of the digest module.


Version 0.12
------------

Released 2012-02-22

-   Fixed a problem with the local timezone being used for the epoch

------------

Released 2011-06-25

-   Refactored interface that the underlying serializers can be swapped
    by passing in a module instead of having to override the payload
    loaders and dumpers. This makes the interface more compatible with
    Django's recent changes.
